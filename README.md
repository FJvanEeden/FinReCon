## Financial reconciliation

##### A functional financial reconciliation project that compares / reconciles two loaded CSV Files.

The goal of this project was to create an application that:

* Select local CSV files
* Simple compare the two selected files
  * Find partial matches where records cant compare 1:1
  * Find all unmatchable records that cant be simply or partially matched
* Display records that dont match

##### User guide

The entire application is currently displayed on a single window. (Subject to change)

The first step would be to use the browse function to retrieve the local CSV files.

Once the files are selected, click the "Compare" button to start the reconciliation process.
